     <p className='mx-10 my-2'>We source all of our coffee beans from Irving Farm, an award winning roastery located in upstate New York.

Our coffee is sourced from hand selected, freshly harvested lots. Seasonal batches are received throughout the year at the Irving Farm, roasted, and promptly delivered to Coffee Shop. We maintain these standards to achieve the highest quality & flavor.

Our house blends are known for their balance and sweetness; resulting in approachable, delicious coffees. Weâ€™ve carefully selected the components for each blend and fine tuned their roast profiles. We also roast a curated selection of single origins to highlight our favorite small lot coffees each season.

Our coffee is always fresh and carefully brewed to bring our customers the perfect cup.</p>
